# loops are useful when you want to execute 1 or more lines of code iteratively / repeatedly
# python loops:
# 1) while loop - this loop continues to run until a terminating condition is met
# 2) for loop - this loop runs for a fixed amount of times
# For loops are mostly used in conjuction with list


# terminator = "-1"  # the progrmas stops when the terminator value is provided

# user_input = ""

# while user_input != terminator:
#     user_input = input("Enter a number:")
